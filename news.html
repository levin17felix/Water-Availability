            <h3><strong>Headline:</strong> Drought grips Kodagu: Cauvery river runs dry, posing threat to wildlife and livelihoods</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2, 2024</p>
            <p><strong>Content:</strong> 
                Kodagu district in Karnataka, famed for its coffee estates and the Cauvery river, faces an unprecedented drought. The river has diminished to a trickle, impacting settlements, agriculture, and wildlife. Dubare, a farming camp, witnesses the Cauvery riverbed littered with rocks, affecting resident elephants. Coffee farmers suffer as blossoms accelerate, but rain fails, risking crop losses. Groundwater levels have consistently dropped over the past decade. Activists cite urbanization, water exploitation, and climate change as causes. The proposed conversion of coffee estates into residential areas raises concerns for the region's ecological balance. Urgent action is needed to protect Kodagu's delicate ecosystem and prevent further water scarcity.</p>

            <h3><strong>Headline:</strong> Threat to water reservoir in India</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 19, 2024</p>
            <p><strong>Content:</strong> India's main reservoirs have hit their lowest March levels in five years,
                 reaching just 40% of capacity. This indicates potential water and power shortages this summer. 
                 The situation is particularly severe in Bengaluru, where water supply is already being curtailed.
                  In Karnataka, the main reservoir is down to 16% capacity. 
                  The low water levels are reminiscent of 2019 when southern cities like Chennai faced water scarcity. 
                  The crisis could escalate with the upcoming extreme heatwaves in April and May. 
                  Concerns extend to other states like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab, where reservoir levels are below their 10-year averages.
                   Sandeep Anirudhan from the Coalition for Water Security warns of long-term risks, including water wars, if immediate action is not taken.
                    Last year's weak monsoon worsened the situation, with India's hydro generation down 17% despite strong electricity demand. Hydropower generation in Asia has plummeted due to sharp declines in China and India.</p>
