    <h1>Water Sources</h1>
    <p>Water sources can be categorized as improved or unimproved, depending on their level of protection from contamination. Improved water sources are generally safer for drinking, while unimproved sources are more likely to be contaminated with harmful bacteria and other pollutants.</p>
    <h2>Improved Water Sources</h2>
    <p>Improved water sources include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Piped water</li>
        <li>Boreholes or tubewells</li>
        <li>Protected dug wells</li>
        <li>Protected springs</li>
        <li>Rainwater</li>
        <li>Packaged or delivered water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2019, 71% of the global population had access to safely managed drinking water services, which means they have access to an improved water source that is located on their premises, available when needed, and free from contamination. However, this number varies widely by region, with access in urban areas generally higher than in rural areas.</p>
    <h2>Unimproved Water Sources</h2>
    <p>Unimproved water sources include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unprotected wells</li>
        <li>Unprotected springs</li>
        <li>Surface water (rivers, lakes, ponds, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to the WHO, as of 2019, 29% of the global population lacked access to safely managed drinking water services, and 144 million people relied on surface water as their primary source of drinking water. In addition, 1.8 billion people used a drinking water source that was contaminated with feces, putting them at risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid.</p>
    <h2>Water Sources in India</h2>
    <p>In India, access to improved water sources varies widely by region. According to the World Bank, as of 2015, 88% of the population in India had access to improved water sources, but this number varies from 98% in urban areas to 84% in rural areas. However, access to safely managed drinking water services is lower, with only 34% of the population having access as of 2017. This means that many people in India still lack access to a reliable and safe source of drinking water.</p>
    <p>To address this issue, the Indian government has launched several initiatives to improve access to clean water,
